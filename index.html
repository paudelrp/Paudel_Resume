									<p> 
										<b>Clinical trial case study in SAS Viya: </b>
										In this project, we cleaned and merged data from various file formats such as .txt, SAS datasets, 
										Excel files, and .dat files using DATA step. In the PROC step, we validate the data and generated 
										output with various plots and table to create visual representations using ODS (Output Delivery System) 
										files such as PDF, RTF, PowerPoint, and PNG. We also used SAS macro variables in SAS Viya, which allowed 
										for dynamic modification of the SAS program through symbolic substitution. The main objective of this project 
										included data handling tasks such as cleansing, importing, validating, exporting, manipulating, subsetting, 
										grouping, merging, and appending datasets. Additionally, we focused on generating basic summary reports, 
										as well as debugging code.

										<b> Heart Failure Data Analysis Using R: </b>
										The heart failure dataset was analyzed using R, applying various data visualization techniques with 
										the help of R libraries such as ggplot2, rpart, randomForest, and dplyr. The analysis aimed to 
										identify the best predictive model using regression techniques, including multiple logistic 
										regression. We used statistical tools such as the logistic function, correlation matrix, 
										and different model-building methods, including forward selection, backward elimination, 
										stepwise selection, and criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian 
										Information Criterion (BIC), to evaluate and optimize the model performance.

									&bull; Developed a highly impactful projected run rate model using linear regression in Power BI with DAX and SQL code, simplifying complex data structures. This model enabled the finance forecast future financial activities based on current run rate trends.</br>
									&bull; Developed a time series seasonal forecasting model help to predict the required number of call center agents based upon the historical data of combine call volume and agent availability. This model helps leadership to determine future staffing needs based on the projected call volume.</br>
									&bull; Developed a Provider Network dashboard in Power BI to visualize key provider information, including claims data and provider counts across the U.S. using map visualization. The dashboard enabled tracking of in-network and out-of-network providers at the city, state, and country levels, and helped identify provider statuses such as disenrollment, in-network, and out-of-network. It also provided insights into provider locations (Single or multiples sites), provider movement in and out of the network, historical claim activity, and overall provider growth.</br>
